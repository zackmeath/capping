<Heading_9LC>PROGRAMS OF STUDY</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>The School of Science includes the following Departments: The Department of Athletic Training, The Department of Biology, The Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry &amp; Physics, The Department of Environmental Science &amp; Policy, and The Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The School offers the Bachelor of Science Degree with majors in Athletic Training, Biology, Biology Education, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry, Chemistry with Biochemistry option, Environmental Science (Policy and Science tracks), and Medical Technology. The Bachelor of Arts Degree with majors in Biochemistry and Chemistry is also offered.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_9LC>MISSION:</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>The School of Science primarily addresses itself to meeting the needs of students majoring in the scientific disciplines. These needs include a sound grasp of theoretical principles and the ability to apply them. A strong emphasis on laboratory experiences and student research is designed to wed theory and practice. Our aim is to prepare students for continuing education at the university level, including programs in the health professions and law, and for entry-level professional positions in the fields for which they have been trained. Consistent with this aim toward professional preparation, science programs stress the broader skills and competencies that form the basis for leadership and management roles in the professions. Consonant with the historical mission of the College, the School also aims to provide students with the content knowledge required for secondary school teacher certification.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>More broadly, the School addresses the needs of every student for scientific literacy. This is achieved within the scope of the Natural Sciences requirement of the Core/Liberal Studies curriculum of the College. Here the focus is on a grasp of the scientific approach to gaining knowledge, a critique of this methodology and its limitations in addressing the full range of human problems and aspirations, and the opportunity to confront, use, and apply the knowledge content of at least one of the scientific disciplines.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Finally, the School recognizes its place within the broader scientific community where it acknowledges a responsibility for contributing to scientific knowledge consistent with its character as a four-year liberal arts college, providing leadership in professional settings, and supporting scientific and educational enterprises in the larger community. Because of the location of Marist College on the Hudson River, these responsibilities take on special meaning when seen in the context of caring for the health and vitality of this extraordinary resource.</_2nd_para>

In addition, the School offers the Master of Arts Degree in Psychology, Mental Health Counseling, Educational Psychology, School Psychology, and a Master’s in Education. (See the Graduate Catalog for information on these programs.)</_2nd_para>
<Heading_9LC>MISSION:</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>Study in each of the School’s undergraduate majors provides students with professional preparation for entry into fields of work associated with the major. Concurrently, students’ learning prepares them for advanced study in career-oriented graduate programs.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The curriculum for each of the School’s majors presents a highly integrated blend of the theoretical and applied aspects of the respective disciplines. This theoretical/applied integration is enhanced by significant internship experiences. Internships are designed for students to continue their learning in real work situations and to have the experience of making learning-based contributions to real problems in the work setting.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The School seeks to accomplish its mission by creating learning environments in which students are encouraged to develop their critical-thinking, problem-solving, self-reflective, self-management, and creativity skills. This occurs in the context of studying course content, learning the methodologies of the discipline, learning skills associated with the discipline, and engaging in the values/ethical issues presented by the discipline. Drawing upon knowledge gained from their broad-based Core/Liberal Arts curriculum, students work with faculty to integrate their professional and liberal arts studies. Faculty also seek to invigorate the learning environment through innovative uses of technology. Throughout the entire program students are given many opportunities to demonstrate progress in fulfilling the requirements of their major.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>From a professional perspective, faculty facilitate students’ internalization of the discipline’s code of ethics. The School’s professional focus is also enhanced by the availability of accelerated, combined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degree programs for exceptional students in the B.A./M.A. in Psychology and the B.A./M.A. Psychology/Educational Psychology with dual certification in Childhood Education and Students with Disabilities 1–6. These exceptional students begin to take graduate-level courses during their undergraduate program. Similarly, graduates from the School’s Social Work major may receive advanced standing in MSW programs throughout the country with significant saving of credits at the graduate level. Students in the Criminal Justice major may begin study in the Master’s/Public Administration Program, and earn an M.P.A. with a concentration in Criminal Justice within one year after graduating with their Bachelor’s Degree. </_2nd_para>

<Heading_14>THE CORE/LIBERAL STUDIES CURRICULUM</Heading_14>
<Heading_9>MOIRA FITZGIBBONS, Ph.D., Core/LS Director </Heading_9>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>One enduring element of the mission of Marist College has been to provide students with an experience that blends career preparation with an education in the tradition of the liberal arts. The commitment of the faculty to providing students with a rounded education is evident in the Core/Liberal Studies Program which emphasizes the following goals:</_1st_para>
<_1_>• To assist and challenge students to become more aware of their own values and the ethical implications of the choices they face in their public and private worlds.</_1_>
<_1_>• To develop in students the capacity to synthesize and integrate methods and insights from a variety of intellectual disciplines.</_1_>
<_1_>• To introduce students to the essential ideas and skills that comprise the disciplines of the liberal arts and the sciences.</_1_>
<_1_>• To develop in students crucial 21st-century skills including critical thinking, written exposition, public presentation, information literacy, and technological competency.</_1_>
<_2nd_para>To achieve these goals, students are exposed to a curriculum that is both integrative and distributive, blending courses that all students take as part of a shared educational experience with elective courses in the liberal arts and sciences.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The Foundation courses in the Core/Liberal Studies Program introduce students to the College as an intellectual community and instruct them in skills they will use throughout their undergraduate experience and beyond. The First Year Seminar introduces students to critical thinking, writing, public presentation, information literacy, and interdisciplinary study through exploration of a focused topic. The other required Foundation course, Writing for College, enables students to develop their ability to critically analyze and learn through writing. Students also learn methods of scholarly documentation and the organization and presentation of ideas. These skills are essential for success in academic and professional life. Each First Year Seminar and Writing for College course engages with one or more of the following themes central to liberal learning: Civic Engagement, Cultural Diversity, Nature &amp; the Environment, and Quantitative Reasoning.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The Core/LS Program’s distribution requirements introduce students to a broad range of disciplines and develop their ability to approach problems in an integrative manner. Breadth courses are content-based and emphasize an understanding of the skills, methodology, and ethical issues of each discipline. Philosophical Perspectives, a Breadth course taken by all students, enables students to examine basic philosophical questions concerning knowledge (epistemology), reality (metaphysics), and human values (ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics) essential to the College’s curriculum as a whole. The 12-credit Pathway component of the distribution requirements offers students the opportunity to explore disparate approaches to a focused interdisciplinary topic.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para> In order to build on the skill instruction provided in the Foundation courses, the Core/LS Program requires that each student complete an “intensive” course in the following skill areas: writing, public presentation, and technological competency. These courses may overlap with courses taken for the Core/LS Program or in the major field of study.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The required Capping Course is a discipline-based experience that addresses the general concerns of the discipline within a wider context and further develops the skills and values awareness developed throughout the Core/Liberal Studies Program.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The Core/Liberal Studies Program outlined below is in effect for all incoming freshmen in Fall 2013 and afterward except students in the Liberal Studies Major. Students who entered the College prior to Fall 2013 should consult earlier versions of the catalog. Students transferring to Marist may receive Core/Liberal Studies credit for courses previously taken. Core/Liberal Studies courses cannot be taken Pass/No Credit.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Once a student has matriculated at Marist, the Core/Liberal Studies Capping Course requirements must be fulfilled at Marist College.</_2nd_para>

<_1st_para>The Applied Mathematics major provides a strong foundation in traditional mathematics, but additionally is interdisciplinary in nature as it addresses the needs of those students interested in scientific or operational applications of mathematical techniques. Such applications can be found in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, computer science, finance, actuarial science, operations research, industrial mathematics, and many others. These applications require an understanding of the appropriate field, so students are expected to choose one of four subfields outside of mathematics in which to specialize.</_1st_para>

<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The Department of Art and Digital Media believes a sound foundation and an exploration of the fields of digital media, studio art, and art history should be combined with a strong liberal arts education to expand the intellectual horizons of our students. The department seeks ways to broaden their intellectual development through the investigation of state-of-the-art technologies in addition to traditional forms of study and techniques. The department believes an education in the visual arts should go beyond the classroom, lab, and studio. Opportunities are provided to exhibit artwork, visit galleries and museums, obtain internships, and study abroad.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The Department’s mission is to prepare students for careers and graduate study in the fine and applied arts. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The B.S. in Digital Media is designed to allow students the opportunity to explore, in depth, the new exciting field of Digital Media under the guidance of recognized working artists, designers, and educators. It combines courses in digital media with a balanced curriculum of studio art, art history, and liberal arts courses. Students will gain broad-based training in a wide range of new media, along with an understanding of their concepts, historical background, and heritage in the traditional media.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The B.S. in Studio Art offers a balance of courses between the traditional art media areas required by the major and the liberal arts courses required by the Marist College common Core. This program will provide a concentrated and carefully structured series of courses organized to enable students to broaden their understanding, aesthetic awareness, and technical abilities in the studio arts. It will also stress the concepts and historical background that have determined the way in which traditional art media have evolved. In addition, this comprehensive program will encourage an awareness of art in relationship to other areas, provide art students with the opportunity to participate in internships, take related courses in other disciplines, and offer students an opportunity to develop their portfolios in preparation for graduate studies. The Studio Faculty is composed of full-time and visiting art professionals who are committed to creating a nurturing but challenging environment in which students can explore, experiment, and develop their own personal visions. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The B.A. in Fine Arts with a concentration in Studio Art is designed to combine a broad-based training in the visual arts with a traditional liberal arts education. After gaining a solid foundation in design, drawing, and art history, each student specializes in one of five tracks: drawing, graphic design, painting, photography, or digital media. Students also select additional studio courses to expand their knowledge of the visual arts. This curriculum is ideally suited for students who want to combine their studio major with a second one or plan a more rigorous study of the liberal arts. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The B.A. in Fine Arts with a concentration in Art History is designed to provide both a survey of western art and an in-depth study of selected periods. In addition to the required coursework, students concentrating in art history must pursue an alternative discipline, preferably in a foreign language. Study abroad is strongly encouraged and the department provides many opportunities for doing so.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>All majors, whether in Studio Art, Digital Media, or Art History, are encouraged to apply for internships in their junior or senior year. The Department’s programs are augmented by trips to nearby galleries and museums in the Hudson Valley, New England, and New York City. There are also noteworthy opportunities to study abroad, particularly at our branch campus in Florence, Italy, as well as short-term programs to Italy, England, France, Spain, and Japan.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The mission of the Athletic Training Education Program is to provide students, within a liberal-arts framework, with the strong scientific foundation and extensive practical experience they need to become certified Athletic Trainers (ATC). Athletic Training is an area of health care concerned with prevention, recognition, care, and rehabilitation of sports-related and similar injuries. Athletic Trainers work as part of a comprehensive sports-medicine team that includes physicians, physical therapists, and other health-care professionals. Upon completion of the B.S. degree in Athletic Training at Marist, graduates will be eligible to sit for the certification examination administered by the Board of Certification, Inc. (BOC). Those passing this exam will be certified as Athletic Trainers by the BOC. The baccalaureate program qualifies students for entry-level positions in high schools, colleges, and universities; professional sports organizations; hospitals and medical clinics; and corporate and industrial settings. Students also may go on for further study in graduate and professional schools. Marist’s Athletic Training Education Program (ATEP) is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) and is registered with the New York State Education Department as a licensure-qualifying degree program.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The ATEP begins with a pre-professional phase which consists of introductory athletic training, biology, and chemistry courses in preparation for full acceptance into the ATEP. Students are also required to complete 60 hours of observation during this phase and submit an application for acceptance into the professional phase of the program. The deadline for application to the ATEP is November 1st for transfer students and March 1st for freshman and transfer students during the first full year at Marist. Admission to the program is competitive and based upon academic performance, references, and an essay, as well as successful completion of the first year’s coursework and observation-hour requirement. An interview may be requested. Transfer admission requirements are available by contacting the Program Director of Athletic Training or the Director of Transfer Admission at Marist College. Applications to the ATEP are available in the Department of Athletic Training. Enrollment in the ATEP is limited to allow an effective student-to-clinical-instructor ratio. Upon full acceptance into the ATEP students must have a physical examination, current CPR/AED certification, training in blood-borne pathogens, complete a technical standards document, and adhere to the Retention Policy. Information on each of these requirements is available in the Department of Athletic Training and can be found in the Athletic Training Student Policy and Procedures Manual. Students are required to purchase clothing and a watch to meet dress code requirements for the ATEP. Any expenses related to traveling to and from clinical sites are the responsibility of the student. Fingerprinting and a criminal background check will also be required and all associated costs will be the responsibility of the student. Refer to the Athletic Training Student Policy and Procedure Manual for specific costs. The most current information on the Athletic Training Education Program is located on the Department of Athletic Training web page: www.marist.edu/science/athtraining/. </_2nd_para>

<_1st_para>In partnership with the Department of Teacher Education in the School of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, the Department of Biology has established a curriculum that leads to provisional New York State certification in Adolescence Education with a specialization in Biology. This curriculum, approved by the New York State Education Department, includes courses in biology and the other natural sciences, as well as courses designed to prepare students for a secondary school teaching career. A supervised student teaching experience, arranged by Marist faculty, is included.</_1st_para>
<Heading_11LC>Requirements for New York State Teacher Certification in Adolescence Education: Biology (Grades 7-12)</Heading_11LC>
<_1st_para>Marist College offers a state-approved program leading to initial teacher certification in Adolescence Education: Biology (Grades 7-12). Students seeking this certification are encouraged to consult with their academic advisor and the Coordinator of Adolescence Education in the Teacher Education Department. Because of the significant number of state certification requirements for this program, it is important that students seek such advisement early in their college careers, during the freshman year if possible. Education and related field requirements for Adolescence Education certification can be found on page 102 of this catalog. </_1st_para>
<Heading_11LC>Program Requirements</Heading_11LC>
<_1st_para>Admission into EDUC 422 and EDUC 464 (Student Teaching) is based on the following:</_1st_para>

<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>The Biomedical Sciences curriculum is an interdisciplinary science program that includes core courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. These courses provide a solid foundation in each of these basic sciences and serve as general prerequisites for admission to most health professional schools. Elective and Core/LS courses will satisfy additional admission prerequisites to master’s and doctoral programs in the health sciences. These schools include, but are not limited to, medical, dental, veterinary, physical therapy, optometry, chiropractic, physician assistant, pharmacy, nursing, public health, and genetic counseling.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>In addition to providing students with grounding in the basic and biomedical sciences, this curriculum allows students whose goals and interests are not in clinical practice to pursue other avenues of opportunity. For example, it also will prepare students for graduate study (i.e., research-based M.S. and Ph.D. degrees) in a wide range of fields in the life sciences, including cellular and developmental biology, molecular genetics and molecular biology, immunology, and other biomedical sciences. Also, many vocations are available to graduates who seek no additional formal education beyond the B.S. degree. These include careers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical diagnostics industries; hospital and independent testing labs; academic biomedical research; and state/federal health or research labs.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Two features of the program – the Introduction to the Health Professions course and required internships in a clinical setting – provide focused information about and direct experience with the health-care system. While most internships will be served locally at Mid-Hudson Regional Hospital, Vassar Brothers Medical Center, or other health-care providers, in many cases students may be able to arrange internships in their hometowns. The inclusion of Business courses as Biomedical Sciences electives represents a distinct difference from any other program of this type, and provides students with the management background so strongly recommended by our Pre-Med/Pre-Health Advisory Board. Students can tailor their coursework and complete any remaining requirements via judicious choice of Biomedical Sciences and free electives, with the help of a faculty advisor.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>However, for medical and most other health professional schools, students can choose any major – including Athletic Training, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, or Medical Technology – prior to professional school application. We note that Marist’s Biomedical Sciences curriculum, as well as the Biology and Biochemistry curricula at Marist, includes all the prerequisite undergraduate courses for the great majority of professional schools.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_11Italic>The Area of Emphasis (12 credits)</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>The broad exposure to business provided by the Business Core is necessary, but not sufficient, for the Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. To develop the capability to contribute to an organization’s competitiveness, the student must also acquire more advanced expertise in an area of emphasis. The School of Management encourages each business administration major to select an area of emphasis that</_1st_para>
<_1_> • reflects his or her interests and talents, and</_1_>
<_1_> • leads to fulfillment of both career aspirations and employers’ expectations.</_1_>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>Students may only select one area of emphasis.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>To fulfill employers’ expectations for entry-level management positions, and thereby enhance first employment opportunities, students frequently select courses which emphasize one of the following areas:</_2nd_para>
<_1_> • Finance (ECON 422, BUS 420, BUS 421, ACCT 330)</_1_>
<_1_> • International Business (BUS 430, BUS 442, ECON 442) and one class chosen from the following list:</_1_>

<_1_> • Human Resources (BUS 401, BUS 402, BUS 410, BUS 413)</_1_>
<_1_> • Customized (by special arrangement with the student’s advisor and department chair and approved by the dean.)</_1_>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>At the time of the declaration of Finance as the area of emphasis, the student must have already earned a grade of C or better in each of the following courses: ECON 103, ECON 104, ACCT 203, ACCT 204, MATH 115, MATH 130.</_1st_para>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>The area of emphasis is a key component of each student’s Study Plan. This plan is developed in consultation with the student’s faculty advisor. Any proposed changes in the courses comprising a student’s approved area of emphasis must be authorized by the appropriate department chair.</_1st_para>
<Heading_11Italic>Interdisciplinary Areas of Emphasis</Heading_11Italic>

<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The mission of the Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry, &amp; Physics is for students and faculty to acquire a better and more systematic understanding of the physical world and to disseminate new discoveries to the greater scientific community. Faculty expand the knowledge, skills, and values of all students, and help transition their learning styles from passive to active. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>In support of this mission, a research-rich, challenging curriculum engages undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry majors amidst a supportive environment featuring exceptional access to faculty and facilities. Two American Chemical Society-approved curricula emphasize extensive hands-on experience with state-of-the-art instrumentation and development of effective communication skills. Computational modeling is integrated throughout the curriculum as one mechanism to blend contemporary practice with traditional methods. A strong sense of community grows from personal attention and individualized mentoring from faculty and support from fellow students. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Students are therefore the central focus and an integral part of the Department, working side-by-side with faculty who are enthusiastically committed to the teacher-scholar model. Faculty strive to be nationally recognized in their areas of specialization by working in research partnerships with students as colleagues. Most departmental majors complete original research projects, many of which culminate in presentation or publication at the national level. Marist Chemistry graduates are superbly prepared to be critically thinking, ethical scientist-citizens, with a balanced understanding of theory and method. Such graduates will be successful regardless of the paths they follow after leaving Marist College. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>In pursuit of the philosophy of “Science without Boundaries,” the Department actively seeks to collaborate with students and faculty from other disciplines. The Department cherishes its role in training students majoring in the other sciences, because the physical sciences underlie processes integral to the life sciences and health professions. The Department recognizes its responsibility to contribute to the understanding and thinking of non-science majors via its involvement in the Core/Liberal Studies program. Faculty and students also use their expertise to provide service to the College and the mid-Hudson Valley. </_2nd_para>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>Departmental Goals</_1st_para>
<_1_>• To be nationally recognized by high schools as a place to send their best students and by graduate schools as a place to recruit high-quality students. </_1_>
<_1_>• To place graduating students in competitive positions of their choice in graduate schools, professional schools, secondary schools, and industry. </_1_>
<_1_>• To provide an environment which fosters continued professional growth of the faculty, including the ability to stay active and vital in their respective fields of research.</_1_>
<_1_>• To engage students in publication-quality research.</_1_>
<_1_>• To contribute to increased scientific knowledge through presentations and publications.</_1_>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>Goals for Students</_1st_para>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>Students Will:</_1st_para>
<_1_>• Achieve Understanding: Chemistry education at Marist College will emphasize depth of understanding over memorization. Faculty and curricula will foster the ability to solve problems through the understanding and application of fundamental scientific principles. Students will demonstrate factual knowledge by application of key concepts to solve theoretical, laboratory, and research problems.</_1_>
<_1_>• Develop Skills: Students will develop skills in: laboratory procedure; data keeping and processing; teamwork and leadership; mathematical reasoning; computational methods; retrieval and use of informational resources; and oral and written communication. Students also will learn and practice safe and responsible methods for chemical work.</_1_>
<_1_>• Develop Values: Students will be held to the highest ethical standards in everything they do, including the recording and reporting of data. Students will also be exposed to other ethical issues in science, including responsible treatment of data, reporting scientific information, ethical misconduct, issues in human and animal experimentation, and the relationship of chemistry to society.</_1_>
<_1_>• Learn Research Methods: Most of our students will learn research methods by participating in original research, working closely with a faculty member. Those who don’t undertake extensive research projects nevertheless will be exposed to the techniques and methods of chemical research through laboratory work.</_1_>
<_1_>• Increase Awareness of Self: Students will become aware of their personal learning styles so that they can develop intellectually and continue to grow intellectually.</_1_>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>Degree Options in Chemistry</_1st_para>
<_1st_para>In order to provide a versatile set of programs for students while maintaining the high quality of the Marist Chemistry experience, we offer four degree options. The B.S. Chemistry and B.S. Chemistry-Biochemistry curricula accommodate those students seeking certification from the American Chemical Society as they prepare for careers as professional scientists in the chemical, pharmaceutical, or molecular industries, or as health-care practitioners. These curricula are recommended for those anticipating graduate-level (M.S. or Ph.D.) study in chemistry, biochemistry, or biomedical sciences. The more flexible B.A. Chemistry and B.A. Biochemistry curricula are designed to have significant quantities of free electives, allowing students to pursue personal and professional interests in other areas such as, but not limited to, business, education, and computer science. The B.A. Chemistry degree is especially well suited for those seeking provisional certification to teach chemistry in secondary schools in New York State or for marketing and sales positions in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The B.A. Biochemistry degree, with proper choice of electives, may be used as preparation for students seeking a career in the health professions.</_1st_para>

<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary program that offers students the ability to study the nature of cognition and its importance in our lives. All students take four foundation courses (Introduction to Psychology, Philosophical Perspectives, Foundations of Cognitive Science, and Moral Cognition) and four distribution courses. The distribution courses come from Anthropology, Biology, Computer Science, English, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Psychology. In fulfilling the distribution requirement, students must take courses in at least three of those disciplines. Of the courses in the distribution requirement, no more than one course can be at the 100-level, at least two courses must be 300-level or above, and no more than two courses (which must be 300-level or above) can be from the student’s major field of study. Coursework for the minor must be completed with a C average. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The minor is appropriate for students interested in exploring different dimensions of cognition, including but not limited to the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive processes, the role of cognition in the productio of purposeful behavior and in making moral judgments, and cognition in non-human animals and computers. The minor will also be useful in preparing interested students for graduate work in any of the various cognate disciplines that together comprise the field of cognitive science.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_9LC>MISSION:</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>The program is designed to challenge students interested in studying the many forms of human communication – its process, outcomes, and effects. The core of this investigation centers on the ways in which human beings purposefully utilize symbols in interaction to create or modify a socially meaningful world. Through courses and internships, the program combines a strong liberal arts background with a professional focus. Inherent in the program’s courses and internships is the integration of communication theories and the liberal arts tradition. This is accomplished through the strategic application of theory to the hands-on practice of communication. The opportunity for internships is readily available, as the strong alumni network of the School ensures that our students intern in some of the top communication organizations in the Northeast, including the major television networks, public-relations firms, radio stations, newspapers, nonprofit and human-service agencies, and Fortune 500 companies. This on-the-job training helps graduates as they prepare to enter this exciting and ever-changing profession. </_1st_para>
<Heading_9LC>OBJECTIVES:</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>Students graduating with a major in Communication should:</_1st_para>
<_1_> (1) have an understanding of communication theory and the ability to translate this theory successfully into practice;</_1_>
<_1_> (2) be able to speak and write effectively;</_1_>
<_1_> (3) be able to function knowledgeably and critically as consumers and practitioners in the diverse fields of communication;</_1_>
<_1_> (4) be media literate;</_1_>
<_1_> (5) have competence in critical thinking and problem solving;</_1_>
<_1_> (6) have an awareness of the moral and ethical issues involved in human communication.</_1_>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>The Communication program offers concentrations in Advertising, Communication Studies, Journalism, Public Relations, and Sports Communication. Communication is a discipline that involves the study of symbolic behavior in many contexts. Regardless of their specialties, communicators are involved in fundamentally similar activities. They gather and process information and create and disseminate messages. Advertisers, journalists, public-relations practitioners, public speakers, television, radio, film, or multimedia producers, and all who communicate with others, engage in these essential operations. </_1st_para>
<Heading_11Italic>Minor and Certificate Programs:</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>The program also includes a minor in Communication for those students who wish to combine the study of communication with a major in another discipline. </_1st_para>

<Heading_9LC>EITEL LAURIA, Ph.D., Director</Heading_9LC>
<SEQUENCE/>
<_1st_para>In addition to its undergraduate major in Computer Science, the Department of Computing Technology also offers a Master of Computer Science/Software Development degree. The Department recognizes that for some outstanding undergraduate students, certain of their undergraduate work might well be reflective of both the content and quality of that typically expected at the graduate level. The Department thus recognizes that these students could participate successfully in graduate classes. For these reasons the Department offers a five-year program in Computer Science, at the end of which the student will earn both B.S. and M.S. degrees. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>This program offers an accelerated way of obtaining a Master’s Degree. Instead of remaining three additional semesters as full-time students to gain the MS at 151 credits (120 + 31), those CS undergraduate students who are admitted to this program will be required to take only 143 credits, or 23 additional credits that can be completed in two semesters, normally the fall and spring following their undergraduate studies. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The five-year program is not appropriate for all students. Qualification occurs in the sixth semester. A cumulative GPA of 3.0, as well as a GPA of 3.0 in the major, is required for acceptance into and continuation in the program. Students interested in entering the five-year program should speak to any CS faculty member early in their studies at Marist, but no later than the beginning of their sixth semester. A faculty recommendation is required for admittance into the program. </_2nd_para>
<_1st_para/>
<Heading_9LC>Five-Year Program</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>The Five-Year program allows undergraduates to earn a B.S. and a M.S. degree in five years. In the current program, students apply in second semester junior year and if accepted, begin the five-year program in the first semester of what would have been their senior year. Students in the current program earn 143 credits.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The Five-Year program in the revised MSCS/SD program is modeled on the current program. The differences are only in the courses the students take and the number of credits in the revised program, which are 144 credits.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The table below gives the full five-year program, starting with freshman year. Starting in the fall of the senior year students take Software Design &amp; Dev instead of CS Project I.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>In the spring of senior year, students take Database Mgt Sys and Track course 1 instead of CS Project II and the undergraduate Elective/Internship.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>In the fall of the fifth-year, students take Security Protocols, Networks, and Track course 2.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>In the spring of the fifth year, students take Project and two graduate electives.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The major in Criminal Justice combines a broad Core/Liberal Arts curriculum with the theory, practice, and experience specific to criminal justice. All courses focus on the study of crime from a variety of perspectives: cause of crime, societal reaction, judicial processing and treatment of offenders, as well as the philosophy and practice of social control and administration of criminal behavior. Emphasis is also placed on critical thinking and problem solving.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The curriculum culminates with two senior seminar courses, which brings together all facets of the Marist College undergraduate experience and the lessons learned in the major. A mandatory six-credit internship enables the Criminal Justice major to experience practical criminal justice from a variety of criminal justice and allied agencies. Internship placements include the range of federal, state, and local agencies.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Experiencing criminal justice in both the classroom and professional world enables students to make informed career choices. Major curriculum completion, coupled with all Core/Liberal Arts requirements, leads to the Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice. A minor in Criminal Justice is also available.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>It is possible for students who plan carefully early in their college careers to double major in Criminal Justice and Psychology. To pursue this option, students should contact the Chair of Criminal Justice or Psychology.</_2nd_para>

<_1st_para>This program is an extension of the Marist undergraduate Dual Certificate Program in Childhood grades 1-6/Students with Disabilities grades 1-6. Outstanding, academically successful (minimum of 3.2 GPA), and highly motivated Marist undergraduate candidates in Psychology and the Dual-Certificate education program may consider applying to the five-year program which combines the Psychology in Childhood 1-6/Students with Disabilities 1-6 undergraduate program with the M.A. in Educational Psychology program. Marist candidates in the five-year program will receive a B.A. in Psychology, earn a New York State Initial Teaching Certificate in Childhood Education 1-6/ Students with Disabilities grades 1-6, as well as an M.A. in Educational Psychology. The five–year program is a 36-credit graduate program. In this program candidates complete 12 credits of graduate courses starting in the spring semester of their junior year, prior to the completion of the B.A. degree program. Student teaching will be completed in the spring semester of their senior year as part of the B.S. degree requirement. The remaining 24 credits are completed in the fifth year, with graduate student status. Admission to this program is granted to qualified applicants in the fall semester of their junior year. The program is a cohort-based program and fits only for undergraduate candidates who graduate with their Bachelor degree in spring. Inquiry about admission should be made to the Director of Graduate Education Programs (Dr. Zsuzsanna Szabo, zsuzsanna.szabo@marist.edu). Application should be submitted in the fall semester of the junior year. </_1st_para>

<Heading_9LC>MARK MORREALE, M.A., Chairperson</Heading_9LC>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The English program offers concentrations in literature, writing, and theatre; the goals and principles underlying these concentrations are the same:</_1st_para>
<_1_>(1) To increase the student’s appreciation and understanding of the literary, pragmatic, rhetorical, and dramatic uses of language.</_1_>
<_1_>(2) To develop the student’s ability to write effectively in a variety of situations.</_1_>
<_1_>(3) To help the student become more receptive to the many-sided pleasures of reading, writing, and oral presentation.</_1_>
<_1_>(4) To enable the student to see how literary and nonliterary texts illuminate the complexity of human experience.</_1_>
<_1_>(5) To heighten the student’s awareness of the moral and ethical implications of literary and nonliterary texts.</_1_>
<_1_>(6) To foster the student’s intellectual, aesthetic, and professional creativity.</_1_>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>The professional goals of the three concentrations are similar:</_1st_para>
<_1_>(1) To prepare students for careers utilizing analytical writing skills and/or performance skills in such fields as business, industry, education, government, theatre, and media.</_1_>
<_1_>(2) To prepare students for graduate studies in literature and writing and in fields that require analytic, interpretive, and writing skills.</_1_>
<_1_>(3) In conjunction with the Teacher Education Program, to prepare students for careers in secondary education.</_1_>
<Heading_11Italic>THEATRE PROGRAM</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>The Theatre Program is the production laboratory to the English Department’s Concentration in Theatre and Theatre Minor. Open to students of all majors, the Theatre Program produces two mainstage productions per year, professional workshops and student projects. A host of theatre courses are offered each year as well. The Marist Theatre Program also includes the student-theatre organization, MCCTA. MCCTA produces several productions a year, including a musical, a comedy or drama, an original play festival and an improv troupe. </_1st_para>
<Heading_11Italic>WRITING PROGRAM</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>The Writing Program includes not only the variety of courses offered by the English Department’s Concentration in Writing and Creative Writing Minor, but also the diverse array of student events and activities of interest to writers outside the classroom. This includes regular visits to campus by established writers in all genres, student readings, excursions to places of literary interest, and popular campus-wide events like the Red Fox Poetry slam. All Marist students are welcome to participate in Writing Program events, regardless of major. Student organizations like the Literary Arts Society and Sigma Tau Delta (English Honors Society) are active in planning many of these annual events, and always welcome new members.</_1st_para>
<Heading_11Italic>CONCENTRATION IN LITERATURE</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>The literature concentration provides students with a sense of the historical development of the Western literary tradition, especially that of English and American Literature. Students also examine how that tradition is continually re-formed and reshaped as writers from previously excluded cultural traditions and once-marginalized groups are added to the canon. Students in the concentration develop the analytical skills and the critical language to describe, analyze, and evaluate literary texts.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>Internships within the English department offer students the opportunity to gain experience in research and teaching, while internships in the private and public sectors present students with the opportunity to gain work experience that utilizes the analytical, interpretive, and writing skills that the concentration fosters. </_2nd_para>
<Heading_11Italic>CONCENTRATION IN WRITING</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>The writing concentration develops the student’s skills in a number of different forms: literary writing, technical and professional communication, print, and writing on-line. Students also have the opportunity to fulfill requirements for the concentration by taking writing courses offered by other divisions of the College (e.g., Writing for Radio and TV and a variety of Journalism courses). </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>Internships with business, media, and civic organizations offer students in the writing concentration the opportunity to gain work experience that utilizes the writing and analytical skills that the concentration develops.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_11Italic>CONCENTRATION IN THEATRE</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>The concentration in theatre offers the student the opportunity to study theatre as the written and spoken work combined with movement in the art of performance.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The play is studied for its literary qualities and as a blueprint for production. New, exciting approaches to interrogating the text and describing the complexity of its sign-system come from changes in the nature and function of literary criticism. While some courses include scene studies, others may be tied to on-campus productions.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Internships in the broad arena of theatre-related activities are possible and require significant dedication to skill development related to the specific focus of the individual internship.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_11Italic>HONORS IN ENGLISH</Heading_11Italic>
<_1st_para>Up to 10% of graduating seniors in English will be awarded honors in the major on the basis of demonstrated excellence and achievement. Departmental faculty will select recipients each spring from among seniors meeting the following criteria:</_1st_para>
<_1_> (a) a minimum of 60 credits earned at Marist College; a minimum of 27 credits earned in English at Marist College;</_1_>
<_1_> (b) a minimum cumulative G.P.A. of 3.25 overall;</_1_>

<Heading_9LC>ZOFIA GAGNON, Ph.D., Chair</Heading_9LC>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>The mission of the Department of Environmental Science &amp; Policy is to educate students to become professionals who understand and solve environmental problems and, more broadly, to create a Marist College student body with a high level of environmental consciousness. The demands upon Earth’s natural resources and life-support systems increase each year as human population and consumption levels increase. Our ability to cope with such demands requires that we educate more of the population about environmental resources, problems, and solutions. Consequently, the Department educates majors to become knowledgeable, skilled professionals and educates non-majors to become highly responsible environmental citizens. Majors also are prepared for advanced courses and research in graduate programs.</CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>
<_2nd_para>The Department is an interactive community of faculty and students, committed to better understanding the environment and the problems confronting it, and to finding solutions to correct them. Students are actively engaged by faculty having diverse expertise in natural and social sciences related to study of the environment. We offer a stimulating and relevant curriculum that incorporates classroom, laboratory, field, research, internship, and seminar experiences. Through this curriculum, we educate for fundamental understanding of the structure and function of natural, economic, and political systems as they relate to the environment. Students come to appreciate the details, complexity, and interrelatedness of systems and problems. We also examine the effects of society’s activities upon environmental resources and their relevance to human well-being.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Given the College’s location, the Department seeks to integrate the ecological features and environmental affairs of the Hudson River Valley, as well as its rich history and culture, into its instructional, scholarly, service, and outreach activities. Moreover, the Department is committed to promoting and contributing to environmentally sustainable practices on campus and beyond. The Department is also committed to the continued professional growth of its faculty, through teaching refinement, scholarly activities, and service to various communities.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_9LC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</Heading_9LC>
<CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>The program provides a strong foundation while also having much flexibility. Two concentrations – Science and Policy – allow for different emphasis. Within each concentration students may choose from a wide range of courses to meet their interests, goals, and requirements. Three environmental minors are also available.</CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>
<_2nd_para>Environmental Science &amp; Policy overlaps with several of the natural and social sciences. Environmental considerations are essential in understanding the biology, behavior, and health of humans and other animals. Our curriculum is beneficial for students interested in zoology, botany, social sciences, liberal arts, business, and international affairs. Students with interests in these and other fields can apply their concern and interest for the environment in either the Science or Policy concentrations. Indeed, this program is well suited to dual majors and minors, allowing students to strengthen their undergraduate education and career preparation. Such preparation is also enhanced by our internships and research requirements.</_2nd_para>

<_1st_para>The Fashion Program builds on the College’s strong liberal arts tradition with a curriculum designed to keep pace with the changing needs of the fashion industry. Students develop creative, technical, and business skills that position them for successful employment in design. Internships are an integral part of the learning experience in the Fashion Program, as is the effective use of technology, including computer-aided design and industry-specific software.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The Fashion Program for Fashion Design features a comprehensive curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The Fashion Design major trains students to create apparel for various markets considering creative, technical, and costing factors. Students develop skills in design, textiles, draping and flat pattern making, garment construction, and computer-aided design. In their senior year, they design and execute an apparel collection under the guidance of a professional designer to be shown at the school’s annual Silver Needle Runway Show. Fashion Design Majors may pursue a minor in Fashion Merchandising or Product Development.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The Fashion Program builds on the College’s strong liberal arts tradition with a curriculum designed to keep pace with the changing needs of the fashion industry. Students develop creative, technical, and business skills that position them for successful employment. Internships are an integral part of the learning experience in the Fashion Program, as is the effective use of technology, including computer-aided design and industry-specific software.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The Fashion Program for Fashion Merchandising features a comprehensive curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree. Students may choose from three concentrations — the Business concentration, Product Development concentration, or Fashion Promotion concentration. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The Business concentration focuses on the planning, procurement, and marketing aspects of the fashion business. Students learn to research target markets, analyze business results, manage the supply chain, and develop strategies that effectively meet the needs of consumers. The Product Development concentration explores the development of private label or branded merchandise, supply chain management, and the use of product data management techniques. The Fashion Promotion concentration is geared toward the student seeking a career in fashion public relations or advertising, event production or on-line promotion. A capping course is required for all senior Merchandising students. The capstone project requires that the student relate his/her knowledge of fashion merchandising and program concentration, related courses and the core, often in collaboration with major fashion companies. Fashion Merchandising students may also pursue a Product Development minor.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_9>MISSION: </Heading_9>
<_1st_para>In a global and interdependent world, no education can be considered adequate without the skill of a second language and the ability to consider the perspective of other cultures. Used by over 200 million people in more than 50 countries around the world, French is a key language for international communication. It is an official working language at the UN, NATO, UNESCO, the International Olympic Committee, the European Union, the International Red Cross, and numerous NGOs. A double fluency in French and English is a competitive asset in the national and international job market for work in international business, the humanitarian and nonprofit sectors, the diplomatic world, the teaching professions, the fields of art history and fashion design, and to meet the requirements of various programs of graduate study. In addition, the study of French offers a tradition of inquiry into the meaning, structure, and practice of Language; a history of critical thought, literature, and fine arts that has shaped the Western tradition; and a window to the rich diversity of African, North American, and Asian cultures that still choose French as a primary or secondary mode of expression. </_1st_para>
<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>The French Program affords the committed student the following special academic options:</_1st_para>
<_1_>(1) An interdisciplinary track for double majors designed to customize the language knowledge to the student’s second field of study, for maximum professional marketability.</_1_>
<_1_>(2) The Marist Abroad Program in Paris, Aix-en-Provence or Marseille, featuring a stay with a French family and opportunity for community service involvement. Programs in Senegal and Morocco are also available.</_1_>
<_1_>(3) Secondary school teacher certification.</_1_>
<_1_>(4) The option to substitute several French courses to fulfill distributive Core/LS requirements in Mathematics, Science, History, or Literature, an arrangement which facilitates a double major or minor in French. </_1_>

<credits/>
<_1st_para>Global Studies is an interdisciplinary program intended to prepare students to live and work in, and make sense of, an increasingly interdependent and multicultural world. Students with an interest in international studies, as well as in careers in business, communications, education, environmental science, history, and politics, are encouraged to consider the minor as a supplement to their major. Courses in the minor focus on the critical study of cultures and systems outside of the United States, as well as on the political, economic, social, and cultural interrelationships within the contemporary global system. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>In addition to the required academic coursework and experience in world languages and cultures, the program actively encourages students to expand their global interests with a regional specialization in their Core and Major courses, and with participation in the Marist International Club, the Marist Foreign Film program, and in community or international organizations. Advanced students have the opportunity to give formal lectures on campus about their global projects or commitments and to link non-classroom international experiences with their chosen field of study. The Global Studies program also works closely with the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures to offer customized support for language study; with the Study Abroad Program to integrate new destinations; and with the Graduate School and Fellowship Advisor to prepare for post-graduation work in international fields.</_2nd_para>

<CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>Foreign Language requirement. Students must demonstrate the equivalent of one year of successful college-level study in a foreign language. They can do this by either (i) taking two college-level foreign-language courses at the elementary level, or one intermediate-level course, which would count as electives for the minor, or (ii) getting approval by the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures to waive the requirement by demonstrating the equivalent of one year of college-level study in a foreign language.</CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>
<CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS/>
<CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>An approved “international experience.” In this component of the minor, students must take part in an experiential project which is international in scope and will normally include foreign travel. The Marist Abroad program experience is strongly recommended, but not required. Other options for the international experience requirement must be approved by the Program Coordinator in consultation with the Global Studies Committee members. These may include independent work abroad with a humanitarian organization; study abroad during a leave of absence; or fluency in a culture other than North-American from extended living abroad.

<Heading_9LC>NICHOLAS MARSHALL, Ph.D., Chairperson</Heading_9LC>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The History Major enables students to make sense of the world that they are inheriting. In order to accomplish this task, students must be grounded in their own historical experience, which should be placed within an emerging international context. In addition, they should recognize the ongoing tensions over the nature of identity: ethnicity, sexuality, class, gender, race, and nationality. To this end, we train students to analyze issues that engage them as citizens of communities, nations, and the world. Our students should expect to confront issues of social responsibility, human rights and dignity, and their role in supporting and encouraging social justice.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The History Department systematically exposes students to a variety of areas: the United States, Europe, and those of the non-Western world. Within that framework, students have ample opportunity to pursue, in consultation with their advisors, specialized interests as career, life, or further educational goals may require. While we do not require study of a modern foreign language, we strongly recommend that path. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>A study of history provides students with a wide variety of skills both for living and for work. A comprehension of the past and the dynamics of change illuminate the present and enable students not only to exercise responsible citizenship, but to enjoy autonomy in an increasingly complex world. Additionally, the study and understanding of history instills or enhances a capacity for analysis and synthesis, and these transferable skills have applicability to a wide range of careers. History opens the door to careers in adolescent and secondary education as well as graduate studies, professional schools, doctoral programs, or law school. The history curriculum also makes a particular effort to advance a central mission of Marist College, to enhance our students’ awareness of enduring values-related issues. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The discipline also offers a concentration in public history, a growing profession. This concentration introduces students to the various applications of historical research and interpretation that occur outside the classroom. Museums, libraries, archives, corporations, and cultural institutions employ public historians to manage resources. Students interested in such a concentration should contact Dr. Steven Garabedian.</_2nd_para>

<_1st_para/>
<_1st_para>The Hudson River Valley Regional Studies minor develops and fosters an understanding of the history, culture, and environment of this region and the place of regionalism more generally. This interdisciplinary minor assists students in understanding their community, the region, and connections of each to the larger world. It employs the ideas and methods of the liberal arts, natural and social sciences, and the fine arts. While the minor focuses on the Hudson River Valley, the knowledge, skills, and approaches to understanding developed can be applied to all regions. The minor is recommended for any student who plans to have a career that depends on ties to surrounding communities such as education, business, politics, or research in the natural or social sciences. Upon completion of the minor, students will understand how the regions where they have chosen to live and to work connect to the larger global community.</_1st_para>

<Heading_14_Grey_Bar> LIBERAL STUDIES</Heading_14_Grey_Bar>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>Recognizing that curricula designed for traditional college students do not always meet the educational needs of adult learners, Marist offers a Bachelor’s degree program especially for adult learners. The Liberal Studies major provides the flexibility to tailor an education that meets an adult’s personal and professional objectives while earning either a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. The Liberal Studies major is available to adult students over the age of 22.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>A Bachelor’s degree with the Liberal Studies major has three main components: the major credit component, the core credit component, and the elective credit component.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The Major credit component requires a minimum of 45 credits. Of these 45 credits, a maximum of 15 credits can be transferred in from another college. Note: remaining transfer credits can be applied to the core and elective credit components following general college guidelines. Earning a Bachelor’s degree with a Liberal Studies major allows students the flexibility, with faculty advisement, to design their major credit component. The major credit component can be broken down into 2 or 3 areas of study. Some common areas of study within the Liberal Studies major are (but not limited to) the following: </_2nd_para>
<_1_> • Paralegal Certificate</_1_>
<_1_> • Leadership</_1_>
<_1_> • Psychology</_1_>
<_1_> • Organizational Administration</_1_>
<_1_> • Professional Studies</_1_>
<_1_> • Communication</_1_>
<_2nd_para>Students can choose courses from the many additional areas of study offered by Marist and design a unique program based on their own previous experience and personal and professional goals.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The Core credit component is comprised of a six-course sequence drawn from various fields of study. These interdisciplinary courses fulfill the general education/core curriculum distribution required in traditional majors. The sequence begins with an initial course that requires students to develop an individualized program of study that takes into account their past educational experiences and their future goals. Subsequent courses focus on integrating learning from various disciplines. The final course in the sequence is the Capping Experience seminar where students apply knowledge from their major in a final project that allows them to consider a significant contemporary issue from an interdisciplinary perspective. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The School of Professional Programs also offers a cohort-based accelerated program as part of the Liberal Studies major. This program includes two predefined areas of study: 1 - Organizational Leadership and 2 - Communication. Students then need only choose a third area of study. The Organizational Leadership and Communication (OLC) program is open to students who have completed approximately two years of college-level work and meet transfer admission requirements. Students in this program have the opportunity to complete their undergraduate degree in as little as two years via an intensive, year-round, six-week course format that consists of one in-person class meeting each week, and additional learning activities conducted online using the iLearn course delivery platform. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>A fully online option is also available for those wishing to major in Liberal Studies. Online semesters are accelerated, comprised of two, 10-week terms. Students have the ability to attend full-time by taking two courses per online term.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_9LC>CATHERINE E. NEWKIRK, M.S., M.T. (ASCP), Chairperson</Heading_9LC>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The mission of the Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences is to provide students with a thorough understanding of the body of knowledge in the field of medical technology and its application in the medical laboratory setting.</_1st_para>
<Heading_9LC>OBJECTIVES:</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>The program of study in medical technology is designed to achieve the following objectives:</_1st_para>
<_1_> • To educate students to perform competently as medical technologists at the career-entry level.</_1_>
<_1_> • To develop in students problem-solving skills and leadership qualities in preparation for educational and supervisory positions in medical technology.</_1_>
<_1_> • To cultivate in students an appreciation for continuing education and the need for lifelong learning in the field of laboratory medicine.</_1_>
<_1_> • To provide students with the foundation for further study and advancement in many academic and professional areas.</_1_>
<_2nd_para>Although not a requirement for graduation, students are prepared and eligible to take national certification examinations. On completion of the degree requirements at Marist College and national certification, graduates are qualified to apply for a New York State Department of Education license to practice in clinical laboratories in the State of New York.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Medical Technology offers exciting educational and career opportunities for students wishing to combine an interest in the sciences with laboratory medicine and diagnostic health care. As vital members of the health care team, medical technologists work closely with pathologists and other physicians to provide information needed for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of disease. Technologists may pursue diverse career opportunities. They may work in hospital, university, government, or industrial laboratories. They represent the upper division of medical laboratory personnel and can establish challenging careers in laboratory administration, specialized research, technical services, marketing, or in medical technology education. Graduates are qualified to enter graduate programs leading to masters and doctoral degrees. Medical Technology, with carefully chosen elective coursework, is an excellent major for students wishing to pursue professional degrees in human medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, physician/pathologist assistant programs, podiatry, physical therapy, and other health areas.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The Medical Technology Program at Marist College is accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS).* The program represents a cooperative effort between the College and regional clinical laboratories to provide a four-year curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Medical Technology. Students have a strong foundation in liberal arts and take courses in biology, chemistry, math, and computer science in preparation for advanced clinical courses. Students in clinical courses on campus gain experience in a simulated medical laboratory. Clinical courses include Hematology, Clinical Microscopy, Clinical Immunology/Immunohematology, Clinical Microbiology, and Clinical Chemistry. The curriculum emphasizes an understanding of the pathogenesis and manifestation of disease analyzed by laboratory testing and the theoretical principles supporting laboratory tests. Students spend six months in affiliated medical laboratories studying diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic monitoring of actual patient cases. They study side by side with professional medical technologists, utilizing state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation, while under the direction and supervision of Marist College faculty. The Marist program is formally affiliated with eight medical centers: MidHudson Regional Hospital of Westchester Medical Center, Poughkeepsie, NY; Vassar Brothers Medical Center, Poughkeepsie, NY; the Veterans Affairs Hudson Valley Health Care System, Castle Point, NY; Kingston Benedictine Hospitals Laboratory, Kingston, NY; St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital, Newburgh/Cornwall, NY; Columbia Memorial Hospital, Hudson, NY; Sharon Hospital, Sharon, CT; and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, NY. All of these facilities are located within commuting distance of the College (except MSKCC, a voluntary rotation site) so students can continue to reside on campus. Students must achieve a minimum grade-point average of 2.5 in all required science and math courses to participate in the clinical portion of the program. A grade of C or better is required in each clinical course (I and II). All clinical I courses must be completed with a minimum grade of C prior to starting the internship phase of the program.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The program provides an opportunity for students with an Associate degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or the Natural Sciences to complete a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Medical Technology at Marist College. These transfer students receive a maximum of 70 credits for courses taken at other accredited institutions of higher education and can usually complete the Marist College program in two years with full-time study.</_2nd_para>

<_1st_para>The Medical Technology Program offers structured programs in four specialty areas of medical laboratory science: Immunohematology, Clinical Microbiology, Hematology and Clinical Chemistry. Students opting for one of these structured programs must have the same educational experiences as a medical technology major and are therefore eligible for ASCP Board examination and certification in that discipline. Students who achieve certification hold the title of Blood Bank Technologist, Microbiology Technologist, Hematology Technologist or Chemistry Technologist, depending on the chosen area of study. The New York State Department of Education does not recognize certification in only one area for licensure.</_1st_para>

Students in structured programs must maintain a minimum grade-point average of 2.5 in all required science and math courses in order to be eligible for an internship. They also will be required to fulfill the same phlebotomy requirements as the medical technology majors during clinical training. Internships, which begin in June and end in December, are complemented by an advanced lecture series on campus. Medical technology majors will be given first priority for internship placement if there is an insufficient number of internship slots due to increased class sizes. </_1st_para>

<Heading_9LC>ANNAMARIA MACIOCIA, J.D., Director </Heading_9LC>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The objective of the Marist Paralegal Program is to offer organized and comprehensive training in the theory, information, and skills required to qualify as a legal assistant, in accordance with the guidelines established by the American Bar Association. The program is offered within the context of the educational purpose of the College and its commitment to a liberal arts, humanist, value-oriented curriculum. Our program meets its objective in a number of ways. Faculty in the program are drawn from Marist faculty and from practicing lawyers and law office administrators in the Mid-Hudson area. The program encourages a generalist orientation among its students, while stressing specific competency in paralegal studies. Program matriculates may satisfy the generalist requirements by having a baccalaureate degree, by being enrolled in the College’s baccalaureate program contemporaneously with enrollment in the Paralegal Program, or by having at least 36 general education college credits. Students acquire competency in paralegal studies by being required to complete successfully the following courses: Introduction to Law; Introduction to Legal Research And Writing; Family Law; Criminal Law; Real Property and Title Search; Business Law I; Wills, Trusts, Estates; and Civil Litigation and Practice. Upon graduation, students will be capable of functioning in all the required areas of study. As examples, a real estate closing, a simple will, a divorce proceeding, a memorandum of law utilizing research tools, and civil trial pleading are but some of the tasks our graduates understand and can complete. Additionally, grasping sufficient legal theory to be able to grow in the profession is required of our students. Successful completion of the program therefore qualifies graduates to serve the many legal needs of the Mid-Hudson area, while contributing to the advancement of the legal profession.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The program combines required paralegal courses with general education courses. In order to receive the Paralegal Certificate, undergraduates accepted into the Paralegal Program are required to matriculate and pursue a major field of study leading to the baccalaureate degree. The certificate will be awarded after a student has completed all of the course requirements in paralegal studies (24 credits) and at least 36 additional credit hours toward the Marist baccalaureate degree. Students already holding baccalaureate degrees are eligible to receive the Paralegal Certificate upon completion of the paralegal course requirements (24 credits).</_2nd_para>

<Heading_9LC>JOANNE MYERS, Ph.D, Chairperson</Heading_9LC>
<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The Political Science Department at Marist College sees its mission as one of enabling students to make sense of the political world and issues they are inheriting, instilling in them an interest in politics, political systems and institutions on all levels, in short, in political life and giving them the tools so they might enable the world to be a better place. We do so by offering a foundation in the four discipline subfields of political science – American government, political theory, comparative politics and international relations. The major is designed with flexibility so that students can develop their own interests in at least two subfields as they grow as scholars. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>Our goal is to assist and mentor students so they are able to think analytically and critically about political problems, both historical and contemporary, issues and ethical dilemmas. Students learn to read primary texts; collect, analyze and interpret data (especially utilizing the resources at the Marist Institute for Public Opinion (MIPO)), distinguish facts that are pertinent to their elegant arguments and communicate – both written and orally, effectively and persuasively. By grappling with the great issues of our time and of the past, the faculty guide students to appreciate the dynamic interplay of theory, methodology and practice in understanding the political world. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>We are committed to helping our students become skilled and proficient communicators. We all recognize that learning to write well is important in the field of political science. To this end, we all emphasize not only the quantity and variety of writing assignments, but the quality of the finished work. Likewise, we also emphasize the ability to craft a good solid argument both orally and in writing. While the classroom is at the heart of the liberal arts education, we also recognize that learning is not limited to the time in class or within the walls of the classroom itself. One of the department’s goals is to turn the entire world into our classroom by taking advantage of the unique opportunities we have at Marist and beyond, including The Marist Institute For Public Opinion (Marist Institute), the FDR Presidential Library, town meetings, academic conferences, the Model United Nations, internships, the Albany Semester, the Washington Semester, Marist Abroad, Pre-law and the American Bar Association approved Paralegal programs. Consistent with the mission of Marist, Political Science challenges students to confront the perennial values and issues involved in politics. The department aims to prepare students for responsible citizenship in our changing world, and to assist students in developing lifelong learning skills and a broad grounding in a liberal arts education. Our students should be well prepared for graduate or law school, the workplace – including public service, non-profits, the media, and corporations – and in the communities in which they reside. </_2nd_para>

<Heading_9>MISSION:</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The psychology major at Marist provides a rich and rewarding educational experience within a strong liberal arts tradition. Psychology courses explore psychological theory as well as the application of psychological principles. The range of application varies from experiences in psychological research courses, where students actually conduct research, to developmental courses, where students can see the relevance of applying principles of development in their own lives. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>As students become familiar with the psychological literature and its applications, they develop a professional orientation that prepares them for entry-level jobs in the field and acceptance to graduate schools in psychology. This professional orientation is supported by field/service learning experiences that are available in the junior/senior year in a local human-service agency, school, or research setting. This undergraduate preparation as a psychology major is valuable not only for students who choose advanced graduate study in psychology, but also as preparation for elementary/special education teacher training programs as well as a wide array of positions generally included under the fields of business management and communication or the pursuit of advanced degrees in other areas such as law or medicine.</_2nd_para>

<_1st_para>The Marist College Social Work Program is dedicated to preparing generalist social work practitioners committed to promoting the well-being of all people and their communities, through an integrated curriculum design grounded in the core values, ethics, and traditions of the profession and that provides the opportunity to master professional knowledge and skills. The Program fosters collaborative relationships with the diverse human services community in the Hudson River Valley to enrich student learning both in the classroom and in the field. The program challenges faculty and students to become social work leaders in the development of a more just society locally and globally.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The Marist College BSW Program has a curriculum which is grounded in the profession’s purpose and values, informed by the program’s context and is driven by the mission of the institution. The BSW Program curriculum prepares its graduates for entry level generalist practice through the mastery of the 10 Social Work Program Competencies (SWPC) and 41 associated practice behaviors as required by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). The goal of competency-based education is to ensure that students can successfully integrate and apply the competencies in practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Competencies are measurable practice behaviors that are based on social work communities. Competencies are measurable practice behaviors that are based on social work knowledge, values, and skills. The total social work curriculum provides opportunities in the classroom and in a range of field education experiences for students to master the practice skills necessary to perform as competent and ethical generalist social work practitioners.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Advisement is provided throughout the program. Advisement plays a critical role, particularly in readying students for thresholds within the major and in evaluating their performance as potential social workers. </_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Minors are available in Social Work and Sociology. The Social Work minor consists of 15 credits and the Sociology minor requires 15 credits. Students should contact the Social Work Program Director to select the appropriate sequence of required and elective courses.

<Heading_9>MISSION: </Heading_9>
<_1st_para>Communication through language is at the core of human experience, and the study of a foreign language provides a powerful key to successful interaction. The ability to communicate efficiently and sensitively in another language with people of different cultural backgrounds can only enhance one’s professional advancement in any career. The Department of Modern Languages and Cultures aims to enrich students’ education by helping them gain a rich preparation for the future through the support of global studies, teacher education, international tracks in other disciplines and, in general, career opportunities in key areas of domestic and international service where knowledge of a foreign language facilitates and increases the level of success.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The Spanish area of the division affords the serious student of a foreign language the following special academic programs:</_2nd_para>
<_1_> (1) Marist International Programs, featuring individual placement, generally during the junior year, in Spain (Madrid, Granada) or Latin America (Argentina, Chile, and Cuba among others).</_1_>
<_1_> (2) Bilingual Education concentration.</_1_>
<_1_> (3) Secondary school teacher certification.</_1_>
<_1_> (4) Latin American and Caribbean Studies program.</_1_>
<_2nd_para>The major outcome of a modern language education is greater self-awareness and an increased understanding of and ability to communicate with people of different cultural backgrounds. In addition, career opportunities in many key areas of domestic and international services are enhanced for the person proficient in a modern language.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Students may apply two language courses at the intermediate level or above as well as a civilization/culture course and two Foreign Language literature courses toward fulfilling the distributive Core/LS requirements. This arrangement facilitates, with proper planning and early implementation, a double major (or minor) with other disciplines such as Political Science, Communications, Criminal Justice, and other majors.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Spanish Majors are urged to spend two semesters abroad in a Spanish-speaking country, but are limited to no more than two semesters and twelve or fifteen credits in the major, according to the chosen track.</_2nd_para>

<Requirements>REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW YORK STATE TEACHER CERTIFICATION 
IN ADOLESCENCE EDUCATION: SPANISH (GRADES 7-12)</Requirements>
<_1st_para>Marist College offers a state-approved program leading to initial teacher certification in Adolescence Education: Spanish (Grades 7-12). Students seeking this certification are encouraged to consult with their academic advisor and the Coordinator of Adolescence Education in the Education Department. Because of the significant number of state certification requirements for this program, it is important that students seek such advisement early in their college careers, during the freshman year if possible.

<_1st_para>Women’s Studies is a multidisciplinary academic program that focuses on gender as a significant cultural and cognitive category. The minor in Women’s Studies exposes students to the intellectual, political, and aesthetic contributions of women to human culture, and examines how gender has influenced the lives, status, and opportunities of all people. Attention is paid to the ways in which gender intersects with race, class, and ethnicity to shape social structures and individual experiences. Courses provide students with a critical approach to the study of history, political science, literature, philosophy, religion, economics, communication, social sciences, the natural sciences, and management, incorporating scholarship on women, gender, and feminist theory. The program advances the Marist tradition of preparing students to develop a global perspective that recognizes and respects diversity.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>Students are required to take an interdisciplinary Introduction to Women’s Studies course and five other courses distributed among at least two different disciplines for a total of 18 credits. Courses that may be applied to the minor include the following regular offerings, as well as designated special topics and cross-disciplinary courses.</_2nd_para>

<coursename>Ethics </coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>The question of ethics or moral philosophy is: What is the good? The field deals with such important sub-questions as: What is the source of moral law – that is, of right and wrong?

What are the character traits – the virtues – by means of which human beings achieve values? This course will study answers to these questions provided by great moral philosophers of history such as Plato, Aristotle, and Kant, and it will examine how these answers can be applied to moral issues relevant today – such as stem cell research, gay marriage and adoption, capital punishment, and torture of terrorists. Offered every semester.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Modern Philosophy</coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>Modern Philosophy begins in the 17th century as a revolt against the centuries-long orthodoxy of Scholasticism, Thomas Aquinas’s synthesis of Christianity and Aristotle. This course will study the new beginning that philosophers wanted to make. These philosophers fall into two groups. One is the Rationalists, whose main figures are Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz; the other is the Empiricists, whose main figures are Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. Both groups are mainly concerned with the same problems: [1] The nature and source of knowledge and [2] the nature of reality. The answers they give, however, are very different. With regard to knowledge, the Rationalists argue that some ideas are innate and that certainty can be acquired only by means of reasoning on the basis of those ideas; information acquired through the senses is unreliable. As for reality, it is not the familiar world we perceive by means of our senses but a world known through reason. The Empiricists, by contrast, argue that the foundation of all knowledge is the information we acquire through the use of our senses; while they do not reject the validity of reason outright, they remain skeptical about its results. Although they believe in a reality independent of the human mind when they start out, near the end they reject that any such reality exists. The course concludes by giving a brief account of how Kant attempted to solve the legacy of problems bequeathed to him by these thinkers. Offered every three years.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Foundations of American Social Thought </coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will examine the major currents in American social thought. Although the course will consider the entire spectrum of the American timeline, it will place its emphasis on the European philosophical heritage of the American “experiment,” on the notion that America’s founding documents form a workable basis for putting its ideas – such as the rights of man and the separation of church and state – into practice, and on 20th-century developments. It will consider the uniquely American interaction between the ideas of individual self-responsibility and communal endeavor. Depending upon student and instructor interest and the state of current affairs, topics selected for special analysis may include religion and morality, civil rights, feminist ethics and gender issues, economic justice, and America’s role in the world. Offered every two years.</coursedescrip>

<coursedescrip>This course will analyze philosophical issues underlying the realm of education. What is the purpose of education? What are schools for? What is the proper content or subject matter of education? What is the most effective means of communicating knowledge? What happens in the teaching-learning process?

In addition to theoretical questions such as these, the course will examine issues such as religious education in public schools, moral education, multicultural and bilingual education, home schooling, distance learning, and standardized testing. Priority to Teacher Education students. Offered according to student and faculty interest.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Social and Political Philosophy</coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>Given that we human beings do and must live together, what form of government should we have, if any? Assuming that we do need a government, what purpose is it supposed to serve? Should the individual serve the state or should the state serve the individual? Do groups have rights or only individuals? What are rights? What is the proper relationship between the government and religion? Should they indeed be separate? This course will address questions such as these. In the course of doing so, it will examine some of the forms of government held up as ideally serving the purpose a government is supposed to serve: absolute monarchy, theocracy, a constitutional republic limited to protecting individual rights, communism, fascism, and the welfare state. The course will examine the views of thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Rawls, among others. Offered every three years.</coursedescrip>

<coursenum>PHIL 235 </coursenum>
<coursename>Philosophy and Technology </coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>The connection between philosophy and technology is intimate. Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to create products or services that serve human needs or values (such as a wagon and a bow and arrow), but the values it can serve may be good or evil (a wagon may serve to transport goods more quickly and a bow and arrow to kill innocent people more efficiently). This course will study these two connections between technology and philosophy. On what does scientific knowledge depend? Why does scientific knowledge—and with it technology – advance in certain cultures and decline in others? Should knowledge and technology be allowed to advance unrestrained because of the good they can do (people being the ultimate cause of the evils they can cause) or should they be restricted because of the evils they can inflict upon us? Do advances in technologies – their workings not understood by most of us – sever and alienate us from the world and others? The course will focus on some of the more troublesome contemporary technologies, such as stem cell research, atomic energy, genetically engineered foods, psychotropic drug therapies, and prenatal testing and selection. Offered according to student and faculty interest.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Aesthetics </coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course serves as an introduction to the fundamental problems of aesthetics and the philosophy of art. Among these are issues of beauty and taste; the nature of art and the aesthetic; and questions about classifying, interpreting, and evaluating artworks. Students will consider prominent historical and contemporary texts, enriched by examples drawn from a wide range of high and popular arts. Through rigorous argumentation and discussion, students will achieve an enhanced awareness of how philosophy can help us understand the arts and the environment that surrounds us. This course can be used to satisfy the Core Fine Arts requirement. Offered every two years or according to student and faculty interest. </coursedescrip>

<coursename>Pragmatism </coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will focus on the philosophy of pragmatism. Pragmatists reject the notion that theory can be separated from practice: a belief is true, the pragmatists argue, if it “works.” While not all thinkers who espouse pragmatism are American, the theory was primarily developed by a number of American philosophers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and has been described by some as a quintessentially “American” way of thinking. This course will examine the works of the “classical” American pragmatists, C. S. Peirce, William James and John Dewey, and it will also explore how the theory has been subsequently developed by contemporary thinkers such as Hilary Putnam, Richard Rorty, and Cornel West. Emphasis will be placed on the pragmatic conception of truth, the pragmatic understanding of scientific and religious belief, and pragmatic approaches to art, education, and moral and political life. Offered every three years.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Existentialism </coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will investigate certain philosophical explanations of the meaning and value of human existence. The types of theories that it will explore argue that action, freedom, and choice are fundamental aspects of human existence. Unlike philosophical systems that define human beings as primarily rational, these philosophies of human existence do not. While they adhere to the primacy of the human being as the basis of philosophy, these philosophies question the primacy of reason and attempt to broaden the meaning of existence. Some of the thinkers that the course may examine include Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, de Beauvoir, Jaspers, and Marcel. Offered every two years. </coursedescrip>

<coursename>Environmental Ethics</coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of the key philosophical issues and arguments within the field of environmental ethics. The questions that will guide our inquiry and analysis include: Do non-living beings and living beings other than humans have a value of their own, not reducible to their instrumental value to human beings? If so, what value do such beings have and why? If not, why not? Do nonhuman beings in our environment have moral standing or is the humanistic understanding that human life is the only value essentially correct? Can we determine the “right thing to do” to nature and nonhuman entities solely on the basis of considering the short- or long-term interests of humans of this and/or future generations? These questions and the diverse answers to them underlie competing views concerning a host of important issues. The development of a comprehensive worldview may be labeled an “environmental ethic.” Offered according to faculty and student interest.</coursedescrip>

<coursedescrip>This course will study the leading thinkers of the medieval period, the time from the collapse of the Greek and Roman civilizations to the Renaissance, and analyze in depth some of the central philosophical questions of the period. Can God’s existence be proven? What is the proper relationship between reason and faith? What is the nature of universals—that is, the “objects” that general terms are supposed to stand for? The course will pay special attention to the two leading thinkers of the age, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Offered every three years.</coursedescrip>

<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will focus on the history of modern philosophy from the late 18th through the end of the 19th century. It will begin by examining how Immanuel Kant attempts to save philosophy from the excesses of Rationalism and the skepticism implied in Hume’s radical Empiricism. It will then examine the series of critical responses that Kant’s philosophy itself engendered. Specifically, it will examine how philosophers such as Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche responded to Kant’s philosophy or its revised or developed versions. PHIL 211 is recommended but not required for this course. Offered every two years. </coursedescrip>

<coursedescrip>This course will explore the origins and development of analytic philosophy, the dominant approach to doing philosophy in the Anglophone world today. It will trace its development from its early origins in Germany, Austria, and the U.K., which led to the formation of the Vienna Circle and the rise and fall of logical empiricism, and conclude with ordinary language philosophy and the advent of eclecticism in the 1960s. As we proceed, we will consider how analytic philosophy emerged in the late 19th century as a movement in philosophy associated with developments in logic and the philosophy of language, how it became conceived as a research project, and finally how it came to be conceived as a way of doing philosophy. While we will explore the history of analytic philosophy chronologically, we will do so by focusing on a handful of topics. Specifically, we will focus primarily on developments in philosophical method, considering its implications for debates in epistemology, philosophy of language, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of mind. Some of the philosophers whose works we might study include J.L. Austin, Rudolf Carnap, Donald Davidson, Gottlob Frege, H.P. Grice, G.E. Moore, Hilary Putnam, W.v.O. Quine, Gilbert Ryle, Moritz Schlick, Peter Strawson, Alfred Tarski, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and others. Offered according to faculty and student interest.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Contemporary Continental Philosophy</coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will focus on developments in Continental Philosophy from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day. “Continental Philosophy” is the general term used to describe the many strands of philosophical thought that originate from the continent of Europe, as opposed to those that are dominant in Britain and the United States. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to some of the most important theories and philosophers in this tradition. We will explore theories such as phenomenology, existentialism, the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, deconstruction, hermeneutics, French feminism, and postmodernism.

<coursedescrip>Dual listed as REST 331</coursedescrip>
<coursedescrip>This course will investigate the philosophical issues inherent in the phenomena of religion and religious experience. It will critically analyze such issues as the existence and nature of god; faith and revelation as sources of knowledge; the creation of the universe; the meaning of existence—for both the individual and humanity as a whole; the nature and source of morality; and the analytic and poetic nature of religious language. The course will examine religious thinkers such as Augustine, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Maimonides, Pascal, Russell, and Aquinas. All students must write an analytic research paper or present to the class an oral report based on their research. Offered according to student and faculty interest. </coursedescrip>

<coursename>Philosophy of History </coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will examine philosophical problems of history, including the nature of historical explanation and knowledge, causality in history, and historical necessity. The philosophy of history raises questions such as: What is the proper subject matter for the study of the human past? The individual subject? The polis or state? The culture? The species? Are there any definable patterns in human history, any signs of ultimate ends toward which events as a whole are moving? Are there any cycles of progress? If so, what are they and what is the driving force of that progress? If history can be said to progress, what is its ultimate direction? If it does not progress, is human history therefore random and devoid of meaning? The course may analyze the thought of figures such as Cicero, Augustine, Vico, Herder, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Dilthey, Danto, and Foucault. Offered according to student and faculty interest.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Metaphysics: The Nature of Reality</coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>This course will examine some of the deepest questions that human beings can possibly ask. What is the nature of reality or existence? Is it entirely material or does the immaterial also exist? Do abstract entities exist apart from the mind? Does anything exist apart from the mind or is the world a mental construct? Does everything happen according to fixed laws of nature or do some things happen simply by chance? What is our self? Is it our body, our soul, or both? If it is both our body and our soul, how are two such radically different things connected? Are we free to choose our actions from a set of alternatives or is everything we do determined by our genes, our upbringing, our environment, or by some combination of these? Students will critically examine possible answers to questions such as these in the history of philosophy, as well as attempt to answer them for themselves. Offered every three years.</coursedescrip>

<coursename>Epistemology: The Theory of Knowledge</coursename>
<coursecredt>Three Credits LA</coursecredt>
<coursedescrip>What is knowledge and how is it acquired? Those are the two basic questions that this course will examine. Is all knowledge ultimately based on the information provided by our senses, or is some knowledge in us at birth? If knowledge is based on the information provided by our senses, how can we ever go beyond this to know about things not available to our senses—like atoms, the shape of the universe, or the nature of our souls? Do we know the world as it really is or only as it appears to us? Or is that a false alternative? What is truth? Is a claim true if it corresponds to the facts or because it coheres with our other claims or because it works to achieve our ends? How do we justify our beliefs? Is certainty ever possible? Students will critically examine answers to questions such as these given by some of the great thinkers in the history of philosophy, as well as attempt to answer them for themselves. Offered every three years.</coursedescrip>

<coursedescrip>Environmental policy touches on nearly every aspect of human life – physical, political, economic, and social – and involves a large cast of characters, including local, state, national and international governments as well as non-governmental interest groups, scientists and the public. For these reasons, the environmental policy process is both complex and deeply consequential for our society. In this course, we will examine the political process as it relates to environmental issues and concerns. We will apply the politics of the environment to particular issues such as air and water pollution, land management, species protection, energy production and use, and climate change. The goal is to help you develop a critical understanding of how environmental policy is made, what challenges and opportunities exist for enacting and implementing policies, and how the process can be improved. </coursedescrip>

In the second part of the course, we explore the tensions that arise as a consequence of national development. These tensions occur as the federal government moves to consolidate national power, industrialize, democratize, and pursue greater equality. The course ends by discussing ideas and institutions during times of crisis as well as considering America’s place in the world. Thematically, the course focuses on the relationship between the individual and the community, the sources of legitimate political authority, the proper ends of government, the relationship between the economy and politics, and the role of diversity in our polity.</coursedescrip>

<coursedescrip>Dual listed as HIST 216 </coursedescrip>
<coursedescrip>This course is designed to explore some important themes concerning race in the American context. We focus primarily on African-American political thought, exploring different ideas, arguments, and concepts about race and society from a multi-disciplinary perspective. We read arguments from journalists, novelists, essayists, academics theorists, and religious and political leaders. The course is organized around four general issues or questions. The first question considers whether race is a biological category or a social construct. The second explores whether racial hierarchy is embedded in the structure of American politics or is a flaw in an essentially fair system. The third topic analyzes two differing approaches to equality: separation and integration. This third section considers arguments about whether integration or separation is the best political strategy for gaining full citizenship rights for African-Americans and other racial minorities. The last issue addresses diversity within the African-American community and considers whether inequality exists within the African-American community itself. We will examine each of these issues mainly through the writings of African-American social and political thinkers. </coursedescrip>

Can we have a just political system without an appeal to controversial moral arguments? Can law articulate universal principles that extend to different genders, races, cultures, classes, nationalities and traditions? How does law resolve the tension between rights and liberties as well as democracy versus the rule of law? How do economic conditions influence the possibility of achieving justice? Readings will come from political theory, legal studies, economics and history. This is considered the thesis and capstone class for Political Science. </coursedescrip>

<coursedescrip>What values are informing present prison structures? How does the stated purpose of prisons as defined by both federal and state mission statements compare to the actual experience of the imprisoned and the systematic administrations of that purpose? We will be engaging in a critical reflection of the experience of imprisonment to investigate the possibility of a socio-spiritual (re)configuration of the prison. This course will consider the social, psychological, political, and spiritual reality related to both prisons and those imprisoned. Among the related issues that we will examine will be social safety concerns and human rights. We will especially consider the experience of imprisonment for women separated from their children, and the effect of present policies on these children. Through Amnesty International, the Index on Censorship, and other work on behalf of human rights, we will also study the situation of political prisoners and pervasive torture in the world today. Given this sort of inquiry is it possible to conceive of values that reflect a more transcendent perspective on the prison experience?</coursedescrip>
<coursedescrip> This course will attempt through readings, film, documentary, voices of prisoners, and a praxis project to gain a critical awareness of the prison system in the U.S. with some comparison to prisons in other countries. We will analyze alternatives to imprisonment and consider possibilities for change. We will also ask existential questions, for example, in what way are we ourselves imprisoned? Is life intrinsically meaningful, even in prison? What is our connection to those in prison? The course will consider different sociopolitical and theological positions infused with a theologically informed liberationist approach. Offered annually. </coursedescrip>

<Heading_9>TITLE IV RECIPIENT POLICY FOR REFUNDS </Heading_9>
<_1st_para>This refund policy is effective as of September 1, 2000 as per the U.S. Department of Higher Education Amendments published on November 1, 1999. This refund policy will apply to students who receive assistance under Title IV funding and/or to the parents who receive Federal Parent Plus loans for their children. Title IV funding includes the following programs: Federal Direct Loan Program, Federal Pell Grant Program, Federal Work-Study Program, Federal SEOG Program, Federal Teach Grant, and the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Students whose Title IV aid consists only of Federal Work-Study earnings are not included in the calculation. This policy begins the first day of classes and is effective for up to 60% of the period of enrollment of the semester in attendance (which constitutes nine weeks of our fifteen-week traditional semester).</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>If the student withdraws from Marist College during the first 60% of the semester, they may be responsible for a portion of the unearned Title IV funds disbursed or that could have been disbursed.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The percentage for which the student is eligible is equal to the percentage of the enrollment period that the student has completed. The percentage is calculated by dividing the portion of the period completed by the length of the payment period. If the period of enrollment is greater than 60% the student has earned 100% of the aid.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>The amount earned is the percentage multiplied by the amount of Title IV aid awarded. The amount unearned is the difference between the amount awarded less the amount earned.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Refunds back to Title IV programs will be assessed by the official date of withdrawal. The official date of withdrawal will be considered the date recorded by the Center for Advising and Academic Services.</_2nd_para>

<Heading_14>FINANCIAL AID</Heading_14>
<Heading_9>MEETING COLLEGE COSTS</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>Financing a college education is a challenge for many families. Recognizing the cost of an education, students should consider the total cost of their education and not just the costs of the initial year. Besides the usual sources—family assistance, personal savings, and summer earnings—there exists a variety of ways to pay college costs. These are generally referred to as student financial aid. They consist of scholarships, grants, loans, and earnings from part-time work while in school.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>If students are in need of financial assistance at Marist College, they should file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Please note that the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) cannot be filed before January 1.</_2nd_para>
<_1st_para> Marist College is concerned that all qualified students have access to a Marist education. Each year, to supplement federal and state financial aid, Marist awards more than $45 million of institutional funds to assist students with financing their education. Overall, almost 83% of the student body receives some form of financial assistance. In addition to need-based grants, Marist awards scholarships to high-achieving incoming freshmen and transfer students.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para/>
<Heading_9>PURPOSE OF FINANCIAL AID</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The purpose of student financial aid at Marist College is to provide assistance to those students who demonstrate financial need. The College maintains that all costs associated with a college education are ultimately the responsibility of the student and the family. Financial need is determined by a formula established by the U.S. Congress, as calculated from data submitted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This formula determines the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), an amount the student and family are expected to contribute toward the education.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The difference between the cost of attendance (tuition, fees, room and board, books, travel, and personal expenses) and the expected family contribution represents the student’s financial need. This is the student’s maximum need-based financial aid eligibility. Utilizing all available resources, Marist College attempts to meet the financial need of its students. Once a student’s FAFSA is processed, an award notification outlining the financial aid eligibility will be forwarded to the student. Awards may include any combination of grant/scholarship, loan, and employment opportunities. These awards are offered without reference to race, ethnicity, sex, age, religion, marital status, or physical disability.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Student financial aid is awarded from two sources: (1) outside agencies such as the federal government, individual states, various public and private agencies, organizations, or companies and (2) the colllege. The following pages contain detailed descriptions of financial aid. Note: Information subject to change. Refer to our web site for updated information regarding institutional, state and federal student aid programs.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_9>FINANCIAL NEED </Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The financial need of a student is the difference between total college costs and the assessed ability of the family to contribute to these costs. The following is an explanation of College Budgets, Family Contribution, and packaging. </_1st_para>
<_1_>1. College Budgets: Budgets should reflect the total cost of education as well as the billable costs. The estimated college cost includes the following for the school year:</_1_>
<_1_> • tuition and fees for a 24-32 credit year</_1_>
<_1_> • charges for room and board</_1_>
<_1_> • books </_1_>
<_1_> • transportation </_1_>
<_1_> • personal expenses </_1_>
<_1_>2. Family Contribution: This figure is determined through a standard needs analysis of the information provided on the FAFSA. The needs analysis takes a number of factors into consideration: income, asset equity, size of family, number of siblings attending college on at least a half-time basis, age of older parent, and whether both parents are working. </_1_>
<_1_>3. Meeting Need: In “packaging” a student with a variety of funding, the college will estimate grants from the following entitlement programs not directly administered by the college: Federal Pell Grants, the NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), and other state programs. The ability of the college to meet remaining need is based on the number of students demonstrating a need and the funding levels for these programs. To assist as many students as possible, the college may set a maximum award for a particular program at a level below that which is legislated. Due to the limited financial-aid dollars available, Marist College awards financial aid to students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis (6 credit hours). Priority is given to full-time students. </_1_>
<_1_>4. Deadlines: It is important to meet the college’s deadline for application for financial aid. While financial aid is awarded on the basis of need, it is also awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. This has implications for following years since priority is given to previously awarded students. The preferred deadline for completion of the FAFSA for incoming students is February 15 while the preferred deadline for returning students is April 15. Returning students please note: If this deadline is not met you may jeopardize your prospective financial-aid award. </_1_>
<_1_> Early Decision Applicants seeking federal financial aid are required to complete the FAFSA. The FAFSA can be found and is available January 1 of the applicable aid year in which you are enrolling. The preferred deadline for completion of the FAFSA is February 15, 2015, and the school code is 002765. If you are applying Early Decision to Marist College, the CSS PROFILE should also be submitted to receive an estimated financial aid package with institutional grant consideration. The CSS PROFILE can be found at http://student.collegeboard.org/profile, and the PROFILE code is 2400.</_1_>
<_1_>5. Reconsiderations: In the event that a student’s financial situation changes despite any financial aid already awarded and the student is unable to meet the cost of attending Marist College, the student must submit a written request to the Office of Student Financial Services to be considered for additional funding. The request, accompanied by supporting documentation, along with the Change of Circumstance Form, which can be found on the Student Financial Services website, should detail the cause and extent of the student’s additional financial need. The verification process must be complete in order for the reconsideration to be reviewed. Reconsiderations will be met depending upon availability of funds.</_1_>
<Heading_9>FINANCIAL AID PHILOSOPHY AND POLICIES </Heading_9>
<_1_>1. Marist College, utilizing all available resources, attempts to meet the financial need of its students. A student’s financial need is determined by subtracting the parent’s and student’s contribution from the total estimated cost of attending Marist College. The total financial aid awarded cannot exceed the college budget. </_1_>
<_1_>2. The amount of a student’s financial aid is contingent upon the student enrolling on a full-time basis (unless otherwise indicated) for each semester awarded. A student may be dropped from the financial-aid program for failure to maintain good standing or satisfactory academic progress. </_1_>
<_1_>3. A FAFSA must be submitted annually as financial aid is not automatically renewable. </_1_>
<_1_>4. The financial-aid award shall be voided if and when incorrect information is revealed on either the student’s application or Student Aid Report. Intentionally filed false statements or materials may subject the filer to a fine or imprisonment, or both, under the provisions of the U.S. Criminal Code. A conviction for any drug offense during a period of enrollment for which the student was receiving Title IV funding (federal aid) will result in the loss of aid eligibility. Please contact our office for information on regaining aid eligibility.</_1_>
<_1_>5. If a student is not permitted to return to Marist College, either because of grades, disciplinary reasons, or an outstanding balance with the Office of Student Financial Services at the beginning of an academic term, the student’s financial-aid award will become void. </_1_>
<_1_>6. Any change in the student’s enrollment, financial, residential status, outside scholarship funds or non-college resources must be reported immediately to the Office of Student Financial Services as they may affect the financial aid package. Institutional aid is not renewable when a student takes a leave of absence. </_1_>
<_1_>7. Availability of funds (state and federal funding) is tentative at the time awards are made and Marist College cannot guarantee substitute awards if any anticipated outside sources of assistance do not materialize. </_1_>

<Heading_9>APPLICATION VERIFICATION PROCEDURES </Heading_9>
<_1st_para>All incoming and returning students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for federal, state and institutional need-based aid. Unless you are awarded a merit scholarship only, incoming freshmen, new transfers, and all students selected for verification must submit a Marist College Application for Financial Aid. While completing the FAFSA, it is highly recommended that you and your parent or spouse utilize the IRS Data Retrieval process provided that the tax return(s) have been processed by the IRS. The IRS Data Retrieval Process will populate the applicable FAFSA data elements from the actual tax return. If the IRS Retrieval Process is not utilized, the IRS transcript will be required. This form is available at www.irs.gov. You may also be required to submit additional verification documentation upon request. If a tax extension has been filed, please submit a copy of that form to Student Financial Services as an extension will not fulfill verification requirements. Students selected for verification during the academic year must submit requested documentation in order to determine eligibility for financial aid. Federal and need-based aid will not be credited to the student’s account until the verification process has been completed. Requested information must be received no later than 30 days prior to the end of the enrollment for the academic year.</_1st_para>
<Heading_9>INDEPENDENT STUDENT STATUS </Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The fact that a student is not receiving financial assistance from his or her parents does not necessarily mean that the student will be considered an independent student for the financial-aid programs.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>For the financial-aid programs administered by Marist College, a student must be 24 years of age by January 1 of the academic year in which he or she is applying. Once the student has filed as a dependent student at Marist College, he or she will be unable to change dependency status except in unusual cases. Supporting documents such as parents’ death certificates, letters from government agencies, lawyers, and/or social workers may be required. The responsibility is on the student to prove his or her independent status.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_14>STATE AID PROGRAMS</Heading_14>
<Heading_9>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW YORK STATE SCHOLARSHIPS AND AWARDS</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>Specific eligibility requirements are explained in detail on the Higher Education Services Corporation website at http://www.hesc.ny.gov (see Student TAP Coach). It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with and to meet the eligibility requirements each term. Generally, to be eligible for a New York State Award, a student must meet the following criteria; however, some scholarships have additional requirements. The general requirements include:</_1st_para>
<_1_>• be a matriculated full-time (at least 12 credits applicable to the program) student. This provision limits the number of general electives a student may take and still be eligible for the scholarship;</_1_>
<_1_>• be a legal resident of New York State;</_1_>
<_1_>• be a United States citizen or eligible noncitizen;</_1_>
<_1_>• not be in default on any State or federal student loan or on any repayment of state awards</_1_>
<_1_>• meet income eligibility limitations</_1_>
<_1_>• have graduated from a high school in the United States, physical proof of high school completion is required to be on file at Marist College, earned a GED or passed a federally approved “Ability to Benefit” test.</_1_>
<_2nd_para>First-time state aid recipients entering as freshman students, or continuing students in the 2006-07 academic year and thereafter with a non-U.S. high school transcript, are required to pass an Ability to Benefit exam. Students must meet the Ability to Benefit requirement before the first day of classes for the term for which they are seeking aid. Please Note: Marist College does not administer Ability to Benefit exams.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>In addition, the student must meet the State-mandated academic requirements for determining program pursuit and satisfactory academic progress. To be pursuing one’s program satisfactorily, a student who is in his/her first year of receiving an award must receive a passing or failing grade in at least one-half of the minimum full-time course load; a student who is in his/her second year of receiving an award must receive a passing or failing grade in at least three-fourths of a minimum full-time course load; in his/her third and fourth years, a student must receive a passing or failing grade in all of the courses constituting the minimum course load. Any course which was passed previously cannot be repeated and counted toward the minimum full-time (12 credits) necessary for TAP eligibility. The only exception occurs when a grade is passing but is unacceptable in a particular curriculum.</_2nd_para>
<_2nd_para>Making satisfactory progress requires that a student achieve a satisfactory cumulative index and accumulate credits at a steady rate. The minimum progress expected is given in chart form (below) and has been approved by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). It is important for students to understand that these criteria only determine student eligibility for a New York State scholarship; they are not the general criteria for academic achievement at Marist College. A student conceivably may meet these standards for a New York State scholarship and yet not meet the academic standards of Marist College for continuation as a student. </_2nd_para>
<_1_>1. An applicant must file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The Department of Education will forward this information to HESC. Students will be given the option of linking to the HESC website to complete the HESC application online. HESC will send an award certificate to the student indicating the amount of the award per term. </_1_>
<_1_>2. TAP awards at Marist currently range from $500 to $5,000 annually.</_1_>
<_1_>3. New York State Scholarships are awarded for eight semesters of full-time undergraduate studies. Students enrolled in the HEOP Program have an additional two semesters of eligibility. HEOP students must indicate they are in an approved five-year program on the FAFSA and TAP applications.</_1_>
<_1_>4. Upon receiving the official notification of the student’s award from HESC, the Certifying Officer will verify the student’s full-time, matriculated status and the tuition charges for the term in question. </_1_>
<_1_>5. If the student meets all of the eligibility criteria, the amount of the award will be credited to the student’s account after the Certification Status Date and upon receipt of a Remittance Advice from HESC. The Certification Status Date is the date upon which the student incurs full-tuition liability for full-time study.</_1_>
<_1_>6. When students are enrolled in a program of study approved to operate on a simulated semester calendar, students must register for and incur tuition liability for full-time study at the outset of the term. If the student meets all of the eligibility requirements, the award will be credited to the student’s account when the student begins study for the last module of the simulated semester and upon receipt of a Remittance Advice from HESC.</_1_>
<_1_>7. If the New York State award results in a credit balance for the student, the College will refund any credit balance within 30 days unless the student requests the College to leave the balance on the account as a credit toward a future term’s charge. (Some restrictions may apply.)</_1_>

<Heading_9>NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>The Tuition Assistance Program was created by New York State as a tuition-related student-aid program. It is designed to assist New York State residents with greater freedom of choice in deciding upon the New York State postsecondary educational institutions that they would like to attend.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>New York State designed the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) so that awards to students attending private colleges are larger than awards for public schools. In this way, the gap between the private and public schools is lessened. Cost becomes less of a factor. TAP awards are not based on gross income. Instead, TAP awards are based on the parent’s and student’s New York State Net Taxable Income (after exemptions and deductions).</_2nd_para>
<Heading_9>PART TIME TAP</Heading_9>
<_1st_para>Part-time students at approved schools in New York State who were first-time, full-time freshmen in the 2006-07 academic year or thereafter, may be eligible for Part-Time TAP to help them pay for college beginning in 2007-08. Part-Time TAP is a grant and does not have to be paid back. Part-Time TAP is not the same as Aid for Part-Time Study.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>To be eligible for Part-Time TAP, a student must be a first-time freshman in the 2006-07 academic year or thereafter, have earned 12 credits or more in each of the two consecutive semesters (one-time requirement), for a minimum total of 24 credits earned, and maintain a minimum of a “C” average. In addition, the student must be a United States citizen or eligible noncitizen, be a legal resident of New York State, have graduated from high school in the United States, or earned a GED, or passed a federally approved “Ability to Benefit” test as defined by the Commissioner of the State Education Department. The student must also be matriculated in an approved program of study and be in good academic standing, be charged at least $200 tuition per year, take at least 6 but fewer than 12 credits (applicable to the program) per semester, not be in default on a student loan guaranteed by HESC and not be in any repayment of state awards. The student must also meet income eligibility limitations.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_9>AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS) </Heading_9>

Similarly, a child of a person who was honorably discharged with a current disability of at least 40% resulting from service during World War I, World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam Conflict, or the Persian Gulf Conflict, or who had such disability at time of death and who was a resident of New York State at the time of induction, is eligible for a Regents award. </_1st_para>
<_1_>1. A student must request a special application from the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation. After eligibility has been approved, the procedures for applying for payment of a Child of a Veteran award, the number of semesters of eligibility a student has, and the procedures at the College for crediting the student’s account are the same as for TAP (above). </_1_>

<_1st_para>These programs are available to New York State residents enrolled in full-time or part-time (three to eleven credits per semester) undergraduate and graduate programs at Marist. Eligibility for VVTA includes U.S. Armed Forces service in Indochina between January 1, 1963 and May 7, 1975 and discharge under other than dishonorable conditions. PGVTA requirements are receipt of the Southwest Asia Medal, issued from August 2, 1990 to November 30, 1995 and confirmation of service in the Persian Gulf. Both veterans’ tuition awards range from $500 to $1,000 per semester with an aggregate limit of $10,000. Veterans who have not established eligibility must complete the VVTA or PGVTA Tuition Award Supplement. Veterans who have established eligibility do not have to submit another supplement, except to receive payment for graduate study they must submit a FAFSA and TAP Application indicating graduate study. Eligibility for these awards must have been established by September 1, 1998. Additional information may be obtained by calling (518) 474-8615.</_1st_para>

<_1st_para>Veterans Tuition Awards (VTA) are awards for full-time study and part-time study for eligible veterans matriculated in an approved program at an undergraduate or graduate degree-granting institution. All academic eligibility requirements for NYS Scholarships apply. </_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>The combined tuition benefits available to a student cannot exceed the student’s total tuition costs. Tuition payments received by a student under the Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) and Yellow Ribbon program are considered duplicative of any VTA and/or TAP award. A student whose benefit is payable under the Post 9/11 GI Bill at 100% will have his/her VTA denied. A student whose benefit payable under the Post 9/11 GI Bill at less than 100% may have his/her VTA reduced. Tuition payments received by a student under Chapter 31 Vocational Rehabilitation are also considered to be duplicative of any VTA and/or TAP award.

<Heading_14>PRIVATE LOAN PROGRAM</Heading_14>
<_1st_para>Marist College offers Citizens Bank, Discover Student Loans, Sallie Mae, and Wells Fargo for our private loan options. Marist chooses to participate in a preferred lender arrangement with each lender so we may better assist our students and families in a more personal fashion. Marist chooses these lenders based on their commitment to the industry, payment and origination or other fees on behalf of the borrower, highly competitive interest rates and terms and conditions, high quality servicing customer service and additional competitive borrower benefits for the student. The choice of a lender is not in any way limited to Marist’s suggested list. If students and their parents choose another lender, they will not be penalized in any way for selecting the lender of their choice.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>Private loans are available to assist students in paying for Marist College. The maximum amount you may borrow on an private loan each academic year per student is the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received.

Students receiving federal financial aid must conform to these requirements in order to be eligible for this financial assistance. These Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements must provide a maximum time frame for completion of the degree, a graduated credit accumulation over this time, as well as a quality mechanism. Essentially, these minimum standards require students to demonstrate that they are actively pursuing their degree. Students may review the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in its entirety at http://www.marist.edu/financialaid/pdfs/satacadprog.pdf</_1st_para>

<Heading_9LC>Montgomery GI Bill—Active Duty (MGIB)—Chapter 30</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>The MGIB program provides up to 36 months of education benefits. This benefit may be used for degree and certificate programs. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may be approved under certain circumstances. Generally, benefits are payable for 10 years following your release from active duty. Veterans may be eligible for assistance under this program if they first entered active duty after June 30, 1985. Veterans who entered active duty before January 1, 1977 may also be eligible for Chapter 30 benefits after December 31, 1989.</_1st_para>
<_2nd_para>Eligibility for benefits is determined solely by the Veterans’ Administration (VA). For further information and applications, contact the VA Certifying Officer in the Office of the Registrar or your local Veterans’ Administration office.</_2nd_para>
<Heading_9LC>Vocational Rehabilitation—Chapter 31</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>The Vocational Rehabilitation program is designed to provide all services necessary to enable a veteran with a service-connected disability to select, train for, and secure employment. Each veteran under Chapter 31 is assisted by both a VA counseling psychologist and a Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist. Vocational Rehabilitation may be provided for up to 48 months. The veteran has 12 years from discharge from active duty to use these benefits. However, the VA may approve an extension of time in certain cases. The VA will pay the cost of tuition, fees, books, and supplies. The veteran also receives a monthly subsistence allowance.</_1st_para>
<Heading_9LC>Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP)—Chapter 32</Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>VEAP is a voluntary contributory matching program available to persons who entered active military service at any time during the period January 1, 1977 through January 30, 1985. The veteran must have completed his/her first period of service and have been discharged under other than dishonorable conditions. The amount of entitlement is contingent upon the amount the veteran contributed. Maximum length of entitlement is limited to 36 months. The veteran has 10 years from the date of discharge to use his/her entitlement.</_1st_para>
<Heading_9LC>Post 9/11 GI Bill—Chapter 33</Heading_9LC>

<Heading_14>THE WILLIAM D. FORD FEDERAL DIRECT LOAN PROGRAM</Heading_14>
<Heading_9>FEDERAL DIRECT LOAN PROGRAM </Heading_9>
<_1st_para>Subsidized: </_1st_para>
<_1st_para>The Federal Direct Loan program which assists students who are enrolled at least half-time (six credit hours per term) in borrowing directly from the U.S. Department of Education. The loans are insured by the federal government. The benefits of the Subsidized Loan are: the borrower is not liable to make repayment on the loan while enrolled in college on at least a half-time basis; the loan is interest-free during the same period of time. </_1st_para>
<_1_> 1. A FAFSA must be filed so that the college can determine the student’s eligibility. The school will certify the student’s enrollment, the college costs, the financial aid available to the student, and the allowable loan amount. Students must also complete a Federal Direct Loan Master Promissory Note. Upon approval of the loan, proceeds are normally electronically transferred to the institution.</_1_>
<_1_> 2. Freshmen can borrow up to $3,500, sophomores up to $4,500, and juniors and seniors up to $5,500 per academic year in accordance with the student’s total family income and demonstrated financial need. (A FAFSA must be filed in order that the college can determine the student’s eligibility.) </_1_>
<_1_> 3. A student may borrow up to an aggregate maximum of $23,000, if he/she is enrolled in a program of undergraduate education. </_1_>
<_1_> 4. The amount the student may borrow is also limited by the student’s enrollment status, college costs, financial aid available to meet these costs, and the satisfactory academic performance of the student. The student must be matriculated and must maintain the cumulative grade-point average and credit accumulation standards established by Marist College. (Refer to Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for more details.) </_1_>
<_1_> 5. The College works with the lending agencies and loan servicers in verifying and maintaining current information on all its student-borrowers. </_1_>
<_1_> 6. A student may be required to pay a loan origination fee. </_1_>
<_1_> 7. A Master Promissory Note must be signed by the student prior to the disbursement of the loan.</_1_>
<_1_> 8. After loan proceeds are credited to the student’s account, any credit balance will be refunded within 14 days. If the student chooses to leave the credit balance on the account, the student must notify the College in writing. </_1_>
<_1_> 9. For loans issued to undergraduate students on or after July 1, 2014, the interest rate is fixed; subsidized Federal Direct Loan = 4.66% until June 30, 2015. Repayment begins six months after graduation, or after the student ceases to be enrolled at least half-time. Interest on this loan is paid by the Federal Government while the student is enrolled at least half time in a degree program. New Federal provisions eliminate the interest subsidy provided during the six-month grace period for Direct Subsidized Loans for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2014. Students receiving a subsidized loan during this timeframe will be responsible for the interest that accrues on the loan during the grace period. If a student does not pay the interest accrued, the interest will be added (capitalized) to the principal amount of their loan when the grace period ends.</_1_>
<_1_>10. A student must not be in default, or owe an overpayment on an FSA grant or loan.</_1_>
<_1_>11. If verification is required, a student will be required to submit documentation.</_1_>

<_2nd_para>For the Direct Unsubsidized Loans, the student is responsible for interest payments while in school. (You have the option to defer payments of interest and principal until after you graduate.) The interest rate for this loan is set at a fixed rate of 4.66% for 2014-2015. Repayment begins six months after graduation, or after you cease to be enrolled at least half-time. Students are awarded a Direct Unsubsidized Loan if their FAFSA information determines they have no financial need. </_2nd_para>
<Heading_9LC>Additional Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan </Heading_9LC>
<_1st_para>This is a student loan program to assist independent undergraduate students or dependent students whose parents do not qualify for a Parent Plus Loan. Eligible freshmen and sophomores may borrow up to $4,000, juniors and seniors up to $5,000.</_1st_para>
