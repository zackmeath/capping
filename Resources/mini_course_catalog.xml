<Heading_14_Grey_Bar> ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE &amp; POLICY </Heading_14_Grey_Bar>
<CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>The mission of the Department of Environmental Science &amp; Policy is to educate students to become professionals who understand and solve environmental problems and, more broadly, to create a Marist College student body with a high level of environmental consciousness. The demands upon Earth’s natural resources and life-support systems increase each year as human population and consumption levels increase. Our ability to cope with such demands requires that we educate more of the population about environmental resources, problems, and solutions. Consequently, the Department educates majors to become knowledgeable, skilled professionals and educates non-majors to become highly responsible environmental citizens. Majors also are prepared for advanced courses and research in graduate programs.</CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>
<CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>The program provides a strong foundation while also having much flexibility. Two concentrations – Science and Policy – allow for different emphasis. Within each concentration students may choose from a wide range of courses to meet their interests, goals, and requirements. Three environmental minors are also available.</CREDIT_REQUIREMENTS>

The certificate program also allows a student to earn 27 undergraduate credits that can be applied toward the Marist Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Systems, or to satisfy prerequisites and reduce the credit load from the Marist Master of Science degree in Information Systems for those already holding a Bachelor’s Degree. The program provides essential knowledge and skills in computer programming, data management, data communications, systems analysis, and systems design.
